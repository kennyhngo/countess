                    Design a world for Marco to navigate through Louser's castle. The castle may contain only up to 10
                    rooms with warp pipes to travel between them. Each room will be the same size (N &times; N). The map
                    should only contain the following characters:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="char">&#x2022; .</span>(period) a walkable space.</li>
                        <li><span class="char">&#x2022; #</span>(hashtag) walls &ndash; which cannot be walked on or
                            through.</li>
                        <li><span class="char">&#x2022; !</span>(exclamation point) one of Louser's minions &ndash;
                            which
                            cannot be walked on or through.</li>
                        <li><span class="char">&#x2022; S</span>Marco's starting location</li>
                        <li><span class="char">&#x2022; C</span>Location of Countess Cherry</li>
                        <li><span class="char digit">&#x2022; A digit '0' to '9' &ndash;</span> indicates a warp pipe
                            traveling to the same spot in the room with the corresponding number.</li>
                    </ul>
                    You should place exactly one locatin for the Countess Cherry and exactly one starting point for
                    Marco, although it is currently not checked. Marco can walk next to minions, but he cannot walk on
                    top of them since he doesn't have time to fight today!

                    Rooms are to be treated as if they are surrounded by walls; treating walls and room edges as
                    impassable terrain. Marco can discover locations North, East, South, or West from any walkable room
                    space, but no discoveries will be made diagonally.
                    <br><br>

                    In addition, when Marco steps onto a warp pipe (digits 0-9), he will <b>only</b> be able to discover
                    the location in the same row and column of the room corresponding to the warp pipe's number. If
                    Marco steps on a warp pipe with digit <em>d</em>, at row and column (<em>r, c</em>), then he'll be
                    able to discover (<em>r, c</em>) in room <em>d</em>.
                    <br><br>

                    It is possible for this to continue from warp pipe to warp pipe, if there are multiple rooms with
                    warp pipes in the same location. If room
                    <em>d</em> doesn't exist, then Marco will not use the warp pipe, and no new rooms will be
                    discovered.

                    The program gets the description of the castle from a text file given by you. The first line of the
                    input must be the letter 'M' (without the quote marks). The second line will be a single integer 1
                    &leq; <em>R</em> &leq; 10, indicating the number of rooms. The third line will be a single integer 1
                    &leq; <em>N</em>, indicating the size of each (and every) room of the castle (each room is N &times;
                    N in size and all rooms are the same size).
                    <br><br>

                    After the first three lines, you may place comments to help you take notes. They must begin with
                    '//' (without the quote marks), and they can be used to describe any noteworthy characteristics, or
                    simply to describe the room number (indexed at 0). That is, room numbers start at 0, and go all the
                    way up to 9.

                    This website has not been optimized for mobile usage and very large castle room sizes yet, nor does
                    it have accessibility features. This project was intended to be a fun side project with a reasonable
                    caslte room size, but feel free to reach out if there are some ideas you would like to see
                    implemented! <br><br>

                    One such idea is to restrict the sizes of the room. Right now, any room size greater than one (1) is
                    a valid room size. However, room sizes that are as big as fifty (50) can cause some funky problems.
                    Room sizes as big as one-thousand (1000) can cause the browser to slow down and become unresponsive,
                    which can be problematic. <br><br>

                    There may also be bugs with the animation part, such as the map glitching when you spam the <em>find
                        the countess!</em> button. Again, I did not design the website to account for users wanting to
                    break the code intentionally. If you use it as it was intended, that is you don't try to mess with
                    the
                    spaghetti code, then it will work nicely.

                    This project is a continuation off of my first project in my <em>Data Structures and Algorithms</em>
                    class <a href="https://eecs281staff.github.io/eecs281.org/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">(EECS 281)</a> at the <em>University of Michigan</em>. As cool as it
                    is to be able to solve mazes with a simple path-finding algorithm, it would be cooler if there was
                    such an animation of finding the path, hence why I created this project and website.
                    <br><br>

                    Since this project is still distributed to current students, the source code for the path-finding
                    algorithm had to be obfuscated to avoid any cheating and honor code violations. If you are a current
                    member in the EECS281 staff and have any concerns (especially since students may use it as a way to
                    test check their program with a valid output), please contact me and I will be happy to discuss it
                    further with you.
